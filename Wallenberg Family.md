# Wallenberg family

The Wallenberg family are a prominent [[Sweden|Swedish]] family, Europe's most powerful business dynasty. Wallenbergs are noted as bankers, industrialists, politicians, bureaucrats, and diplomats. The Wallenberg sphere's holdings employ about 600,000 people and have sales of $154 billion a year. The Wallenberg empire consists of 16 Wallenberg Foundations, Foundation Asset Management AB (FAM), Investor AB, Patricia Industries and Wallenberg Investments AB.

The net worth of the Wallenberg family was estimated at €250 billion by the Financial Times, as of 2015. In the 1970s, the Wallenberg family businesses employed 40% of Sweden's industrial workforce and represented 40% of the total worth of the Stockholm stock market. By 2011, their conglomerate holding company, Investor AB, had an approximate ownership of 120 companies. In 2015, the family still owned a third of Sweden’s entire stock exchange. 

Investor AB is a Swedish investment and de facto conglomerate holding company. It was founded in 1916, and is still controlled by the Wallenberg family through their Foundation Asset Management company FAM. The company owns a controlling stake in several large Swedish companies, with smaller positions in a number of other firms. Investor AB was established by the Wallenberg family in Stockholm in 1916, when new Swedish legislation made it more difficult for banks to own stocks in industrial companies on a long-term basis. The shareholdings of the family bank, Stockholms Enskilda Bank (SEB today), were transferred to Investor AB, a newly formed industrial holding company spun out of the bank.


Investor AB own significant minority stakes in listed companies and are typically the largest shareholder.
