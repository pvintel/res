# Ericsson
Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (lit. "Telephone Stock Company of LM Ericsson"), commonly known as Ericsson, is a Swedish multinational networking and telecommunications company headquartered in Stockholm, [[Sweden]]. The company sells infrastructure, software, and services in information and communications technology for telecommunications service providers and enterprises, including, among others, 3G, 4G, and 5G equipment, and Internet Protocol (IP) and optical transport systems. The company employs around 100,000 people and operates in more than 180 countries. Ericsson has over 57,000 granted patents and created the Bluetooth technology. 

The company was founded in 1876 by Lars Magnus Ericsson and is jointly controlled by the Wallenberg family through its holding company Investor AB, and the universal bank Handelsbanken through its investment company Industrivärden. The Wallenbergs and the Handelsbanken sphere acquired their voting-strong A-shares, and thus the control of Ericsson, after the fall of the Kreuger empire in the early 1930s.

### Ericsson pays Bill Clinton $750K for speech
Ericsson decided to sponsor a speech by Bill Clinton and paid him more than he had ever been paid for a single speech: $750,000,” Schweizer writes. “According to [[Clinton Foundation|Clinton]] financial disclosures, in the previous ten years Ericsson had never sponsored a Clinton speech. But now it apparently thought would be a good time to do so.” Clinton gave the speech on November 12, 2011. “One week later, on November 19, the State Department unveiled its new sanctions list for [[Iran]],” the book continues. “Telecom was not on the list.” Even when Obama imposed sanctions on telecom sales by executive order in 2012, “those sanctions did not cover Ericsson’s work in Iran.
