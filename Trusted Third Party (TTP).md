## Trusted Third Party (TTP)

These so-called "trusted third-parties" may be the most important tech companies you've never heard of. These companies work as middlemen or "brokers" of customer data between ISPs and phone companies, and the U.S. government.

By implementing these government data requests with precision and accuracy, trusted third-parties — like [[Neustar, Inc.]], Subsentio, and Yaana — can turn reasonable profits for their services.

Little is known about these types of companies, which act as outsourced data brokers between small and major U.S. ISPs and phone companies, and the federal government. Under the 1994 law, the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA)]], any company considered a "communications provider" has to allow government agencies access when a valid court order is served. No matter how big or small, even companies whose legal and financial resources are limited do not escape federal wiretapping laws. 

On a typical day, these trusted third-parties can handle anything from subpoenas to search warrants and court orders, demanding the transfer of a person's data to law enforcement. They are also cleared to work with classified and highly secretive [[The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) | FISA]] warrants. A single FISA order can be wide enough to force a company to turn over its entire store of customer data. [^1]
