Swedish Telecom began in 1853, established by the Swedish government as Kongl. Elektriska Telegraf-Verket when an electric telegraph line using the Morse system was opened between Stockholm and Uppsala. Since then the company has operated under a variety of names, including Telegrafverket after 1860 and Televerket since 1953. The opening of the initial electric telegraph line was followed by the rapid development of a widespread telegraph network, consisting initially of single-wire telegraph lines. By 1854 the first telegraph line to the continent via a submarine cable was opened, and by 1857 a telegraph line was completed between Ystad and Haparanda, linking Sweden from north to south.

In 1877 the first telephone line was installed, only one year after Alexander Graham Bell's invention. At the beginning of that year it was demonstrated in Sweden to King Oscar at the Royal Castle in Stockholm. By the 1880s private telephone societies were founded in most of Sweden's large towns. By 1885 Stockholm had more telephones than any other city in the world. By the turn of the century, Telegrafverket had installed 62,000 telephones, plus several exchanges of varying sizes.

In 1918 there was a major change in the company's status when it purchased the telecommunications firm Stockholms Allm&auml--a Telefon AB, which was responsible for the largest telephone exchange in Sweden. Telegrafverket had for some time challenged this company's dominance in taking over telephone subscriptions and long-distance calls. Although the market was still formally open, the buy-out resulted in a national de facto monopoly, as no other competitor seemed to have the financial means or technical resources to mount a challenge.

### Swedish government lobbied Hillary Clinton to ditch Iran sanctions

The [[Clinton Foundation]] raised $26 million in Sweden even as the Swedish government was lobbying Hillary Clinton's State Department to forgo sanctions that threatened business dealings with Iran. The Swedish organization, named the William J. Clinton Foundation Insamlingsstiftelsem, wasn't run by State Department ethics officials, according to the Washington Times.

The [[United States Department of State]] declined to blacklist any Swedish firms with economic ties to [[Iran]], according to diplomatic cables obtained by the paper. "Sweden does not support implementing tighter financial sanctions on Iran" and believes "more stringent financial standards could hurt Swedish exports," reads one cable sent to the State Department.

### Sweden blocks EU effort to add telecom firms to international sanctions

Sweden blocked an effort by other EU states to add two telecoms firms in Syria with commercial links to Swedish firm Ericsson to an EU sanctions list this week, EU diplomats said.

European Union foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday agreed to add 11 Syrian firms or entities to the sanctions list as part of international efforts to end government violence against pro-democracy protests.

The 26 other EU countries had wanted to add two Syrian telecoms firms to the list, but Sweden threatened to block the entire package if they were included, the diplomats said.

## Swedish Kings of Cyberwar

On April 24, 2013, just weeks before Edward Snowden went public with his leaks about mass surveillance by the [[National Security Agency (NSA)]], General Keith B. Alexander, then the head of the NSA, welcomed a group of Swedish intelligence officials to a secret three-day meeting at NSA headquarters.

In the delegation were Ingvar Åkesson, the longtime director of Sweden’s National Defense Radio Establishment (known as the FRA, for Försvarets radioanstalt), a shadowy Swedish government intelligence agency, and five members of Åkesson’s senior staff. One of the aims of the meeting was to discuss Sweden’s growing importance to the NSA.

In a 2008 law, the FRA had been given expansive powers by the Swedish government to vacuum up all communications traveling over fiber optic networks into and out of Sweden, including e-mails, text messages, and telephone calls.

This was of great interest to the NSA, not least because a large percentage of Russian communications traveled through Sweden. In 2011, the Swedes began sharing their surveillance data with the NSA, which included, as NSA officials described it at the time of the meeting, a “unique collection of communications data on high-priority Russian targets such as leadership, internal politics, and energy.”
