# Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)
**Science Applications International Corporation** (**SAIC**), Inc. is an American company headquartered in Reston, Virginia that provides government services and information technology support.

The original SAIC was created in 1969 by J. Robert Beyster. Then on September 27, 2013, it spun off a $4 billion unit which retained its name, while the parent company changed its name to Leidos. Following the split, Anthony J. Moraco was appointed CEO of SAIC, and John P. Jumper was appointed CEO of Leidos.The primary motivation for the spinoff was the conflicts of interest provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation which prevented the company from bidding on some new contracts because of existing contracts.

On May 4, 2015, SAIC acquired Scitor Holdings, Inc. for $790 million to expand their presence in the intelligence industry through classified contracts, cleared personnel, and a robust security infrastructure. Scitor was previously owned by Leonard Green & Partners, L.P., a private equity firm.

On September 10, 2018, SAIC announced its acquisition of Engility, a competitor in the U.S. government services contracting sector, for a combined US$2.5 billion with the merger set to take place in January 2019.

On February 6, 2020, SAIC announced its acquisition of Unisys US Federal, a competitor in the U.S. government services contracting sector, for a combined US$1.2 billion.
