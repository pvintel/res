## Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999

The official emergency number in the United States and Canada is 911. Although the first 911 call was placed in Haleyville, Alabama in 1968, it was not until 1999 that the United States Congress directed the [[Federal Communications Commission (FCC)]] to make 911 the universal emergency number in the United States for all telephone services.

The 911 network is now a vital part of our nation's emergency response and disaster preparedness system. Emergency personnel and others often learn about emergencies through 911 calls. Dialing 911 quickly connects a caller to a nearby [[PSAP (Public Safety Answering Points)]]
dispatcher who is trained to route your call to local emergency medical, fire, and law enforcement agencies.

## Basic 911 #Basic911

Basic 9-1-1 means that when the three-digit number is dialed, a call taker/dispatcher in the local [[PSAP (Public Safety Answering Points)]], or 9-1-1 call center, answers the call.

## Enhanced 911 #Enhanced911

In areas serviced by enhanced 9-1-1, the call is selectively routed to the proper PSAP for the callerâ€™s location, and the PSAP has equipment and database information that display the caller's phone number and address to the call taker. 93% of counties with 9-1-1 coverage have enhanced 9-1-1 for callers.
