Rodney Joffe is the person referred to as “Tech Executive-1” in [[Michael Sussmann]] indictment for allegedly lying to the FBI by withholding his connections to Hillary Clinton’s losing 2016 election campaign against former President Donald Trump, according to CNN. Sussman was acquitted from a DC jury but what was released through discovery still paints the conspiracy story with high level VIPs.

Joffe advised not only FBI brass but White House officials on cybersecurity matters. By 2016, his access to proprietary internet logs became of interest to operatives for the [[Hillary Clinton Campaign]], who appear to have offered him a job in a Clinton presidency. (Shortly after Clinton’s loss to Trump in November 2016, Joffe said in an email: “I was tentatively offered the top cybersecurity job by the Democrats when it looked like they’d win. I definitely would not take the job under Trump.”)
