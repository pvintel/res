# Bell Communications Research Inc.

Bell Labs, renamed from the original Volta Laboratory founded by Alexander Graham Bell, has been credited with many amazing advancements in the fields of computer science and telecommunication like the invention of the C Programming language and the operating system Unix. It has a great and complicated history as a subsidiary of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. When an anti-trust supreme court case broke up AT&T in 1982, Bell Labs was retained by AT&T while the local operations of AT&T were split up into the Regional Bell Operating Companies.[^1]

This separation meant that a whole sector of what was previously the AT&T company had no central organization for research and development – it was cut off from Bell Labs. The Regional Bell Operating Companies needed a place to centralize software, research, training, and settings. That’s why Bell Communications Research, Inc or Bellcore was created.

Bellcore was never a part of the official “Bell Labs” but it certainly is connected in that the administrative work that was previously being done in the historical Bell Labs now was being done in Bellcore. In fact, much of the staff and corporate culture of Bellcore was carried over from Bell Labs. Bellcore is better known as [[Telcordia Technologies, Inc.]] - the later name given to this operation. The practical running and work culture of Bellcore has historically been and to some extent still is a mystery.

To gain more clarity about what Bellcore might have been working on in the years following the company’s break-up, I spoke to Nilesh Shah who was an employee at Bellcore in the 1980s. Nilesh Shah is now the CEO and founder of Nichetech, a consulting and software development company based in India.

Graduating from Stevens in 1984, he started working in Piscataway, New Jersey in 1986- the headquarters of Telcordia. As a masters student in computer science, he worked for 10 years at Bellcore as a programmer, senior programmer, consultant, senior consultant, and account executive for the company and was there for some interesting changes. For one he was there as the company transitioned away from Bell Labs and he went as far as saying “when I was at Bellcore, it was actually an extension of Bell Labs.”

Bell Communications Research Inc., known as Bellcore, may be the telecommunications industry's best-kept research secret.[^2]

On March 5, 1986, Bellcore, the tenth company to register an Internet domain name in com TLD, provided joint research and development, standards setting, training, and centralized government point-of-contact functions for its co-owners, the seven Regional Holding Companies that were themselves divested from AT&T as holding companies for the 22 local Bell Operating Companies.
