## PSAPs (Public Safety Answering Points)
PSAPs (Public Safety Answering Points) are responsible for receiving 911 calls and processing those calls according to a specific operating policy. You might think of these as a dedicated call center for answering emergency phone calls and dispatching appropriately.

In December 2003, the FCC began collecting data to build a registry of public safety answering points (PSAPs).  A primary PSAP is defined as a PSAP to which 9-1-1 calls are routed directly from the 9-1-1 Control Office, such as, a selective router or 9-1-1 tandem.  A secondary PSAP is defined as a PSAP to which 9-1-1 calls are transferred from a primary PSAP.  The PSAP database serves as a tool to aid the Commission in evaluating the state of PSAP readiness and E9-1-1 deployment.

****The Registry lists PSAPs by an FCC assigned identification number, PSAP Name, State, County, City, and provides information on any type of record change and the reason for updating the record. The Commission updates the Registry periodically as it receives additional information. For further information concerning the FCC's Master PSAP Registry and carrier reporting requirements, or to notify the Commission of changes to the PSAP Registry,**** **please send an email to [fccpsapregistryupdate@fcc.gov](mailto:fccpsapregistryupdate@fcc.gov).**

## Integrated Voice Response (IVR)
The availability of Wireless Number Portability began in November of 2003 by FCC Rule. The current revision to this document included the recommendation that PSAPs register with the [[Neustar, Inc.]] Integrated Voice Response (IVR) Unit to facilitate access to subscriber information for ported and pooled telephone numbers.

The Emergency Services Interconnection Forum (ESIF), a work group of the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) developed a template to be used by PSAPs requesting customer information under exigent circumstances. This form is attached in Exhibit B.
