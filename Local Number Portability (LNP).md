## Local Number Portability
Local number portability was mandated in the U.S. by the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]]. The act provided the regulatory framework for LNP implementation, intended to provide competition in the local telephone services market after deregulation of the telephone industry in 1984. However, a number of events between 1984 and 1996 led to the development and implementation of LNP in the U.S.

Local Number Portability (LNP), also known as number portability and number porting, enables end users to keep their telephone number when switching from one telecommunications service provider to another. Prior to the introduction of LNP, changing service providers meant having to get a new telephone number. Number porting changed that, making it possible for consumers to retain the same telephone number.
