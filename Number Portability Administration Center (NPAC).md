## Number Portability Administration Center

Following enactment of the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], Neustar (as Lockheed Martin IMS) was selected by the telecommunications industry and approved by the [[Federal Communications Commission (FCC)]] to be the Local Number Portability Administrator (LNPA). As the LNPA, [[Neustar, Inc.]] developed and began operating the Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC) in 1997.

The NPAC initially supported the routing of 4 billion telephone calls and 6 billion text messages every day for the telecommunications industry. It does this by storing the relationship between telephone numbers, service providers, and network routing instructions, and broadcasting updates to the entire communications network when they happen. In this way, Neustar makes sure that you can take your number with you when you switch to a new telecommunications carrier.
